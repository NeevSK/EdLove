# EdLove Ecosystem Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Build a unified **EdLove Ecosystem** containing:
1.  **EdLove Web** (`edlove.org`): The "Paradigmatic Cosmos" (Astro + Svelte).
2.  **Gurudevi Mobile** (`gurudevi`): The "Operational Engine" (Expo + React Native).

## 1. Folder Structure: Monorepo (Turborepo)
**Verdict**: **KEEP the Monorepo Structure.**
Why? "EdLove" and "Gurudevi" are two lungs of the same body. They share design tokens, types, and potentially content.
- `apps/edlove-web` (New! Astro)
- `apps/gurudevi-mobile` (New! Expo)
- `packages/ui` (Shared Gluestack config)

## 2. Tooling: pnpm + Turbo
**Verdict**: **Yes, use `pnpm` and `turbo`.**
- **pnpm**: Fast, disk-efficient, strict dependency management.
- **Turbo**: Handles the build pipeline for both apps perfectly.

## 3. How We Proceed (The "Fresh Start")
We will effectively "Re-initialize" the current folder to match this new vision.

### Step 1: Clean & Init
- **Action**: Rename/Archive current `apps/web` (Next.js) to `apps/_archive-web`.
- **Action**: Run `pnpm init` and `npx turbo@latest init` if needed to refresh config.

### Step 2: Initialize Web (EdLove) - "The Whole Canvas" Strategy
**Philosophy Update**: We respect the "INFJ Vision" (The Whole). We will NOT build just one page.
- **Action**: We will scaffold the *entire* Hexagonal Architecture navigation immediately.
- **Action**: All 6 Domains will be visible in the menu, even if some lead to "Unfolding Soon" skeletons. We paint the whole canvas lightly, then detail it.

### Step 3: Initialize Mobile (Gurudevi) - **PAUSED**
> [!WARNING]
> **BLOCKED**: Waiting for friend's unpushed changes. We will not touch `apps/gurudevi-mobile` until further notice to avoid merge conflicts.

## 4. Workflows & Agents (Brief)
- **Parallelism**: Currently, I work sequentially (one step at a time). True parallel agents require a different "Swarm" architecture.
- **Trade-off**: Parallelism = Speed, but High Complexity/Conflict risk. Sequential = Clarity/Consistency, but slower.
- **Our Mode**: We are "Pair Programming". I am your hands and tactical brain. You are the Visionary.

## User Confirmation Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Web Start**: Ready to scaffold the **EdLove Web** with the full "Six Domain" navigation structure?
